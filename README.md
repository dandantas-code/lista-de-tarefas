# lista-de-tarefas

In this project, I did my first task using Javascript, HTML and CSS. 
The user need insert the task; and when he already finalized, the user will press 'Enter', for to the task he inserted, will be inside to the list.
Also, the user can remove the task pressing the 'x' on the right side on the list.
